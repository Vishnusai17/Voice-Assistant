## 🧩 Example Interaction

**User:**

> "Hi, we’re in New York City — what’s the time right now and how’s the weather?"

**Gemini AI:**

> “With the clear weather, a perfect way to spend the afternoon is an outdoor stroll that offers great city views. Walk the High Line and Chelsea Market: The High Line is an elevated park built on a former rail line, offering unique perspectives of the city, art installations, and plants. It’s perfect for a pleasant afternoon walk.
Have a wonderful time out tonight!”
